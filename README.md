# Synopsis
A music manager/ format converter written in python.

# Motivation
I wanted something to easily convert my music from flac to a smaller sized format for my phone.
I mostly wanted to screw around with python..

# Features
- **None yet. xD**
- Will support converting to/from flac (why convert *to* flac?), mp3, ogg. Maybe more later.
- Will fully support and preserve id3 tags.
- Will cache encodes for faster future transfers.
